# Roomm8s (Roommates)

Manage common things between roommates, like whose turn it is to do the
 dishes, share grocery lists, and easily split rent costs. This app was an entry in the HackED 2019 hackathon. 
 
 I still work on this from time to time. 
 
 A demo version is available at [roomm8s.net](https://roomm8s.net). 

## Install and setup for your own server

You must configure a SECRET in a `.env` file.
